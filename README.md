Savitri - Compliance Tracking Assistant

Savitri is a unique app for the healthcare sector, which was intended to help clinics and hospital to keep track of various healthcare relevant compliances easily.

Leave the task of compliance renewals on us, so you never have to worry about it, thereby doctors and staff can focus more on what truly matters, serving their patients.

Just add your compliances, and Savitri will remind you about renewals of those compliances when they near the expiration date. We send regular alerts through app notifications, SMS and emails, based on your subscribed plan. So you never have to bear the loss of non-compliance in your healthcare institution.

Now with Savitri, it is easier than ever to manage compliance related tasks or even delegate it to other staff members of your organization. You can keep a close watch on the status of the renewals tasks, as Savitri informs you of every update through app notifications.

Not only does Savitri remind you for compliance renewals, but it also automatically catalogs all your previously renewed compliances(based on your subscribed plan) for your easy access anytime, anywhere.
